    <h2>Steps in e-Pak Ag development</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        Growing and sharing good practices.
    </p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify priority crops and associated priority needs and opportunities for each crop/commodity</li>
<li>Identify and review existing extension materials related to priority opportunities</li>
<li>Identify, collate and/or develop needed training and extension materials <br><strong>Note:</strong> Where possible, build off and link to existing credible, relevant sources, identify distribution options and potential linkages,</li>
<li>Help make materials available - through the site and/or through other sites.</li>
<li>Collect feedback on the site and materials and respond (by improving both).</li>
<li>Meet with partners to collect feedback on direction and contributions.</li>
<li>Conduct workshops and/or training to exchange good practices on material development to improve materials, sites and access to materials.</li>
<li>Pursue linkages with those using information - respond to feedback to improve both the site and materials.</li>
</ul>


<p>e-Pak Ag. Sharing good practices. Consider a critique e-Pak Ag (or other sites like e-Afghan Ag including critique of actual training and extension material) and identification of good rpactices with a self evaluation of both sites and materials.</p>
<p>There are obviously a lot of extension oriented sites in Pakistan and we need to see how we can help each other. I believe site enhancement and material development are possible focal points - ensuring </p>
<ol>
    <li>
        clarity of audience,
    </li>
    <li>quality of material - I.e,, making sure it is concise, credible, relevant, practical, easily found (on a site) and easily understood</li>
    <li>collection of feedback from target group users to improve the sites and the materials.</li>
</ol>

<p>1)<strong> Vocational training (across the AIP partners)</strong> - Delivery was the top listed priority. This will likely start as a series of short courses (say 1/2 to 1 day courses in a couple of places. (Other topics include communication, leadership, data and experiment management and proposal writing.) I envision participants being accepted on the condition they demonstrate - after the workshop - application (or sharing) of elements covered during the workshop. For all training we want to make sure we use best practices for adult learning (I.e., engage and involve the learners - don't just talk at them).</p>
