    <h2>About e-Pak Ag</h2>
    <p> The Agricultural Innovation Program (AIP) is a USAID supported project, led by CIMMYT and implemented by CIMMYT and IRRI for <strong>cereals</strong>, ILRI for <strong>livestock</strong>, AVRDC for <strong>vegetables</strong> and UC Davis for <strong>perennial tree crops</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>graduate study</strong> and <strong>vocational training</strong> programs. </p>
<p><b>Two of the goals for e-Pak Ag are:</b></p>
<ol>
     <li>be a repository for useful project extension and training materials, and</li>
     <li>be a catalyst for bringing key Extension partners (using ICT) together to share and use good practices. e-Pak Ag is our entry into that discussion.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What do good practices encompass?</h3>
<p>Any ICT application must be to provide information that is: Needs-driven, Credible, Relevant, Concise, Clear, and Practical</p>
<p>Also an interface has to allow for information to be easily found. I am an agronomist who uses ICT (not an ICT "guru"). Thus I come at ICT very much from the practical stand point. ICT is a tool - it is only as good as the ease with which the information can be accessed and trusted.</p>
