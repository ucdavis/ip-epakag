    <h1>Turning Information into Action</h1>
    <p class="lead">We all know a lot of research results don't reach the intended users. How can we improve this?</p>
<p>These three simple questions can help turn your information into action. </p>
<ol>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Can people easily access my information?     How can people use your information, if they don't know about it?)</b></li>
        <li><b>Will people be interested in my information?     Or is the information more for my interests?)</b></li>
        <li><b>Can people easily test your information? </b><b>   Why should they trust it? Is it easily understandable and doable?</b></li>
    </ol>
</ol>
